# Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode)

## Problem Description
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.


## Approach (Backtracking + recursion)
- I tried myself in the pen paper, by making a string and then dividing it into parts.
- Then I wrote a isPalin code to check the palidromic sequence, made a function which name getpartiotions which included partitioned string, ans string and then I GOT BLAMKED.....

- After few minutes of Thinking i jumped into the vdo solution from SHRADHA KHAPRA MA'AM lecture to check the process of the answer...
-I missed few steps of backtrackig and recursive calls..


## USING CHATGPT AND MA'AMS LECTURES I COMPLETED THE REMANING CODE AND POSTED IN GITHUB ##

# KEY CONCEPTS USED:

-Recursion
-Backtracking
-Palindrome Checking
-Substring manipulation
